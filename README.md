# Training NASNet in PyTorch on CIFAR-10

This is a port of the [tensorflow definition of nasnet][tf], created by
refactoring the [implementation of the Large and Mobile in PyTorch by
Cadene][cadene] so that it would be possible to define the CIFAR-10 version
of the network. Also, code to implement the path-based dropout and
auxiliary classification head output has been added.

## Training details
